Interceptors are a way to do some work for every single HTTP request or response.
Here are a few examples of common use cases for interceptors:
Add a token or some custom HTTP header for all outgoing HTTP requests
Catch HTTP responses to do some custom formatting (i.e. convert CSV to JSON) before handing the data over to your service/component
Log all HTTP activity in the console
